## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The History of Piracy
From ancient times until its peak in the 17th century, pirates stole what did not belong to them. At the time, what was worth money were goods and gold that moved between the seas around the world ([Source](https://super.abril.com.br/historia/no-tempo-dos-corsarios-e-piratas#:~:text=Na%20verdade%2C%20a%20pirataria%20n%C3%A3o,Gr%C3%A9cia%20at%C3%A9%20o%20imp%C3%A9rio%20romano.)).

The term "piracy" with a meaning of a stolen product, that is, an unauthorized copy of the original, appears for the first time in an English document dating from the 17th century to refer to text thieves ([Source](http://abril.com.br/mundo-estranho/por-que-usamos-o-termo-pirata-para-produtos-falsificados)), which today is better known as plagiarism.

Nowadays, goods such as software, games, music, films, books, and many other things, protected by copyright laws, are the most susceptible to these acts of piracy. In the gaming industry specifically, in the early 90s games were already pirated by transferring their files and media to a computer and making them available on the internet ([Source](https://www.redbull.com/br-pt/piratas-foram-os-primeiros-historiadores-dos-games)). And what used to be a certain sentence to the gallows, today goes unpunished by most systems due to the difficulty of connecting the act to the pirate.

</br>

### 1.2. The Problems
The cost of piracy is practically impossible to measure given its intangible and/or difficult to measure consequences, such as:
- **Loss of revenue**

  Game development companies do not receive the expected money, and since building a game is a long and high-cost process, this loss ends up being passed on to the end consumer, resulting in increasingly higher prices for the customer.

- **Security and privacy**

  Anyone who uses pirate games is facing high security and privacy risks as these games may contain malware and viruses.

- **Competitive disadvantage**

  Pirate versions of games may contain ways to gain unfair advantages in online games, which harm the gameplay and experience for all players.

- **Impact on creativity**

  Having a game pirated, with the insertion of unfair advantages and compromising security, can ruin a game's reputation. And all of this can have consequences for the creation and innovation of new content. Imagine taking years to build something and in days other people destroy it? It shakes anyone's in good faith.

- **Legal Problems**

  In addition to harming the entire ecosystem, from the industry to the legal customer, users of a pirate version put themselves at risk of facing legal action and being arrested.

- **Bad investment**

  Buying games can be considered a bad investment since the amount to buy them will never be recovered by the consumer.
  
- **Devaluation**

  The value of a game continuously drops after its launch period, and eventually stops being lucrative for the developers.

</br>

### 1.3. Market Size
As mentioned in the item above, piracy is hard to measure. According to researchers, the gaming industry's losses reach around 30% of the global market revenue. In current numbers, that translates to over 118 billion dollars per year. Also, consider that it has been estimated that the global market revenue is going to reach 548 billion dollars in the next 6 years, which elevates the losses to more than 164 billion dollars a year.

Another thing we have to keep in mind is the users: there are 3 billion of them around the globe. Also, gaming is not restricted to teenagers anymore: 83% of users are between 16 and 44 years old.

</br>

### 1.4. Trident: The Solution
To overcome this old problem we had to use technological tools and creativity to create the ultimate solution against game piracy. We were inspired by Poseidon, the god of the seas and protector of the sailors. With his Trident, symbol of power and strength, he can control the waters and create storms.

That way, we united the best of the WEB2: the games, with the best of the WEB3: the blockchain, to secure digital creation and innovation with a system that assurance the authenticity and integrity of games with unique and immutable records, guaranteeing long-term revenue to developers. Also, we open a new horizon of possibilities for the player, such as selling the game legally and democratizing access to games.

</br>

### How we do it
We are able to prevent piracy by making the game access limited through an NFT-Key, so even if someone has a copy of the game he cannot execute it. Therefore, without the _advantages_ of buying an illegal copy, piracy would not occur.
With an NFT the player and the developers gain:
- players are also owners, of their NFTs, and can sell them and recover part of their investment or reinvest in new games.
- by eliminating piracy and the loss it causes to the industry, developers would gain up to 30% plus on sales and also guarantee a lifetime revenue that would come from the re-sells. That means every time a player sells his NFT, the developers are going to receive a percentage that is intrinsically and directly from this sale.

All of that consequently reduces the final price of games making it more accessible to people!

</br>

## 2. Trident Protocol Prototype
As mentioned, Trident merged Web2 and Web3 to solve one of the biggest problems of games and software in general. To do so, we use Web3 primitives such as NFTs and ERC20 to ensure uniqueness and easy negotiability with Chainlink Solutions and the old and good .exe software in C#.

Our collectible NFTs are the key to accessing the game. Although a user somehow obtained the game, it will not execute. Because every time he tries to run it, our system will check for the NFT-Key of that specific game in his e-mail wallet. If the NFT-Key is not there, the game will not open.

To access the game, the user must access the site, buy the game, and wait for Chainlink functions to process the request. Once it's finished, the user will be able to play. And, of course, once bought, the game is yours. You will be able to sell it if you want. But don't worry. When the NFT-Key is transferred, the receiver can start playing immediately, and you will lose access.

Chainlink revolutionized the blockchain into a safe cross-chain environment, and we must take advantage of it. So, the user can pay for the game with CCIP-compatible tokens in any CCIP-compatible EVM.

Once a new game is launched, our IA buddy starts to monitor user's opinions on social media. By doing it, we can retrieve valuable and spontaneous opinions about our games. Once a day, Chainlink Automation will trigger our Chainlink Functions, which will call our AI buddy to start checking the heat.

## 5. Next Steps
1. Implement improvements to reduce the cross-chain messaging time to users.
2. Implement a swapping functionality that allows users to buy using any Dex-tradable coin. However, receiving in specific stable.
3. Expand the proposal to other software, not only games.
4. Standardize the process to allow companies to incorporate it into existing infrastructure.
   
Trident's next steps are to refine our integration, reinforce security measures, and start building new features. Our goal is to abstract complexity to facilitate mass adoption. For the web3 users, we plan to develop a swapping mechanism by integrating Chainlink Price Feeds for users to just select any DEX-tradable token, and we do the rest receiving it in a CCIP-compatible one. It also can be achieved by integrating already well-designed and functional BUILD protocols like Concero and others. Trident will also improve some of the features already implemented as the royalties and lock period systems to cover the Publisher side of the business. The NFT-Key tiers and Chainlink VRF are great tools for publishers to create marketing campaigns and foment their communities to increase revenue.
